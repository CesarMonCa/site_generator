# Site Generator
 a static site generator from scratch! A static site generator takes raw content files (like Markdown and images) 
 and turns them into a static website (a mix of HTML and CSS files).
 
## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CesarMonCa/site_generator.git

## Acknowledgements
This project was made possible thanks to the tutorials I followed at boot.dev
