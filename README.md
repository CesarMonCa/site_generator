# Site Generator
 a static site generator from scratch! A static site generator takes raw content files (like Markdown and images) 
 and turns them into a static website (a mix of HTML and CSS files).

 When converting, it will only support a single level of nesting when it comes to inline elements.
 This is supported:
 This is text with a **bolded phrase** in the middle
 
 This is NOT currently supported(Might add support for it later): 
 This is an *italic and **bold** word*.

 
 
## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CesarMonCa/site_generator.git

## Acknowledgements
