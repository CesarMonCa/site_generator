# My goals and reflecting on my Journey 

**For something more interesting than me talking about myself I created this post about my trips in Japan**. Read my [first post here](/majesty)

> I created this webpage to reflect on my goals. The other purpose of this webpage is to have a project to showcase my skills to the graduate department at UT austin.

## Reasons I studied English and Linguistics at UT

* I moved to the US from Honduras 10 years ago when I was about 18 years old. My english was not very good and I wanted to learn English better to be able to be part of my local community and not be looked down when applying for jobs because of my accent.  
* Learning English was very fun, but at the time it was something I did out of necessity and not because I wanted to pursue a career in English education. Back in highschool I really wanted to learn programming to make videogames, I took art classes in community college to learn how to make my own sprites and wanted to learn on the side. But I felt left behind because of my poor English skills.  
* I learned to love linguistics and languages, learning English and Japanese gave me the confident in myself to pursue other studies. I took Biology, Calculus and Intro to programming at UT once I felt my English was good enough to understand advanced topics in the sciences. 
* I dont want to limit myself to one thing, I want to become fluent in Japanese as well as in programming languages like Python, Java, c#. Learning languages is like a puzzle that often doesnt make much sense but I enjoy taking a crack at it. 

## why not programming at UT?
* I tried to at least get a certificate at UT and took some classes to prepare to transfer to CS like biology and calculus but I ran out of money and I wanted to at least travel a bit before going back to school as I was exhausted with balancing work and school at the time.
