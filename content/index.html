<h1>My goals and reflecting on my Journey</h1>
<p><strong>For something more interesting than me talking about myself I created this post about my trips in Japan</strong>. Read my <a href="/majesty">first post here</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I created this webpage to reflect on my goals. The other purpose of this webpage is to have a project to showcase my skills to the graduate department at UT austin.
Please keep reading to know more about myself unless it will make my application look less favorable. If so please stop reading and close the webpage! There is nothing here but my ramblings.</p>

<h2>Reasons I studied English and Linguistics at UT</h2>
<ul>
<li>I moved to the US from Honduras 10 years ago when I was about 18 years old. My english was not very good and I wanted to learn English better to be able to be part of my local community and not be looked down when applying for jobs because of my accent.</li>
<li>Learning English was very fun, but at the time it was something I did out of necessity and not because I wanted to pursue a career in English education. Back in highschool I really wanted to learn programming to make videogames, I took art classes in community college to learn how to make my own sprites and wanted to learn on the side. But I felt left behind because of my poor English skills.</li>
<li>I learned to love linguistics and languages, learning English and Japanese gave me the confident in myself to pursue other studies. I took Biology, Calculus and Intro to programming at UT once I felt my English was good enough to understand advanced topics in the sciences.</li>
<li>I dont want to limit myself to one thing, I want to become fluent in Japanese as well as in programming languages like Python, Java, c sharp. Learning languages is like a puzzle that often doesnt make much sense but I enjoy taking a crack at it.</li>
</ul>
<h2>why did I not take more programming classes at UT?</h2>
<ul>
<li>I tried to at least get a certificate at UT and took some classes to prepare to transfer to CS like biology and calculus but I ran out of money and I wanted to at least travel a bit before going back to school as I was exhausted with balancing work and school at the time.</li>
</ul>
<h2>for no reason whatsoever print hello world</h2>
<p><code>func main(){
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}</code></p>
