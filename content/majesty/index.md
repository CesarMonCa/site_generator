This winter vacation I visited Osaka, Kyoto, Nara, Tokyo and Mt.Fuji in Yamanashi. I currently live in Okinawa so I dont have dont get much time to visit the mainland except for the holidays, thats why I took the opportunity to go around Japan and get to do all the touristy things that I could do in 2 weeks!

## Osaka

> I forgot to take a picture of the outside of the castle so here is one I found from google :)

I really enjoyed visiting Osaka and enjoyed its food and atmosphere. Met some awesome travelers from all over the world and had a blast visiting non-touristy restaurants and food stands around the city. I also visited the Osaka castle, although it looks like a well preserved Japanese castle it is actually a modern museum on the inside. It was interesting but I was a little disappointed to know that the original interior of the castle was not preserved.  

## Kyoto

Kyoto was aboslutely beautiful. The shrines and temples around the city really gives that vibe of "traditional" Japan. Although sometimes it feels like it is an image fabricated for tourists so that you get a feeling of "wow I am experiencing a different culture!" "this is what Japan is all about!" it is still beautiful place to visit. I also had the opportunity to had for the first time A5 Kobe steak and it was the best steak I ever had. Overall loved Kyoto, probably best place to take pictures that convince your friends and coworkers that you went to a different country.

## Temples in Japan

### My list:

I visited many temples and shrines in the two weeks that I visited mainland Japan. 
I am going to talk a little about them here by:

- **Inari Shrine**: The first shrine I visited in Kyoto. It is famous for its thousands of torii gates, there are a more than 10,000 Torii gates in the shrine. Besides being a great place for taking pictures it is also quite a good place for a light hike, it takes about 1.5 to 2 hours walking to the summit of mt. Inari following the red gates. 
- **Kiyomizu**: It is absolutely gorgeous even during the winter which is not the season for sakura flowers the temple is surrounded by beautiful flowers and greenery that makes it look like a place you could only find in fantasy books. 
- **Sanjusangendo**: This is my favorite temple, I got the a goshuincho which translates to “honorable stamp/seal book." The temple holds 1001 buddha statues on its interior. It is a surreal experience to see them all together. Sadly you cant take pictures of the inside but it I think it is worth to see at least once when visiting Japan.
- **Tenryuji Temple**: The Tenryuji was a little lackluster. You can enter inside, but there is not much to see that you couldnt find elsewhere in Kyoto. It has a beautiful pond near the temple, and it has a relaxing atmosphere even with all the tourists. 
- **Kinkakuji Temple**: Like Tenryuji this temple also doesnt have much going for it, it is beautiful from afar but it there is nothing beyond simply seeing the golden leaf walls. This is one of the temples were seeing a picture online of it is enough. I wouldnt recommend visiting. 


## Conclusion

I had a great time visitng mainland Japan. There are many things I left out of my experience like temples and places in Tokyo and also my first time in Mt. Fuji but I think this is good enough for the purposes of this document. I had a great experience and that I am glad that I was able to visit the places I have only known in pictures online. My next adventure in Japan will probably be Hokkaido, but right now I am looking into visiting other countries in Asia.
